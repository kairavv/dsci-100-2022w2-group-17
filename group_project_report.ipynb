Guests evaluate the quality through an online/digital rating system. Attributes of Parisian Airbnbs have been identified and collected into a data set on Kaggle. Utilization of this data allows us to analyze trends in Airbnb prices and popularity across different cities and neighborhoods and identify factors that may influence prices and demand. The data set includes 19 variables in each respective column, with each row documenting an Airbnb's price. \n",

    "Similarly, this example shows that an increase in the distance from the metro station generally results in a decrease in guest satisfaction ratings. This is evident from the majority of scatter points being clustered towards the upper-left hand side of the plot, with some of the most expensive Airbnbs being located close to a metro station."

    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "During our analysis of the factors that affect Airbnb prices, we found several predictor variables that play a role in determining prices, such as location, guest satisfaction score, cleanliness rating, etc. Thus, it would be appropriate to conduct data analysis with all filtered variables in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualizing the results of the analysis, a scatter plot or heat map can be created with prices as the dependent variable and the most prominent variables as independent variables. This way any trends or patterns that may exist can be more easily visualized. "

    "### Expected outcomes and significance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What do you expect to find?\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that the proximity of Airbnb locations to popular attractions and amenities (metro stations) will have a positive impact on guest satisfaction and increase of listing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What impact could such findings have?\n",
    "These findings could influence the location of new Airbnb listings and their amenities as they would be catered to guest preferences. The pricing and marketing strategies of Airbnb's would also be affected if the data support the prediction. Airbnb’s near popular attractions or public transportation can command higher prices for their listings. Those farther away may need to adjust their pricing strategy or marketing approach to remain competitive. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 3. What future questions could this lead to?\n",
    "These impacts lead to two questions: 1. This impact allows us to question what businesses will be most affected by increasing tourism, both positively and negatively, and 2. What amenities or attractions are most strongly associated with higher guest satisfaction and pricing in different cities or regions? \n",
    "\n",
    "These findings could lead to further research to determine which specific businesses or industries would be most impacted by increased tourism, both positively and negatively. Additionally, future research could investigate the amenities or attractions that are most strongly associated with higher guest satisfaction and pricing in different cities or regions."
