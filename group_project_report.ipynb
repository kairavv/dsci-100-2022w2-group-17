    "Airbnbs have specific attributes (room type, cleanliness rating, superhost status etc.) that determine its price and perceived quality. Guests evaluate the quality through an online/digital rating system. Attributes of Parisian Airbnbs have been identified and collected into a data set on Kaggle. Utilization of this data allows us to analyze trends in Airbnb prices and popularity across different cities and neighborhoods and identify factors that may influence prices and demand. The data set includes 19 variables in each respective column, with each row documenting an Airbnb's price. \n",

    "## Methods\n",
    "Methods will include the Preliminary exploratory data analysis and the Data analysis section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set will be read from the web link and wrangled into a tidy format. Then, it will be split into training and testing data subsets with a 0.7 proportion, with a seed of 8888 for consistency throughout the analyses. The training data will be used to train a classification model, and the testing data will be used to evaluate its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform preliminary exploratory data analysis by finding statistics of the training data subset, such as the distribution and range of the location, guest satisfaction score, cleanliness rating, etc., to gain insight into our data set and how we will further our data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a total of 7 potential predictor variables in this dataset. However, some predictors may not be relevant to our project. Therefore, we will selectively filter the appropriate predictor variables based on their correlation with the class variable. First, we will determine the respective correlation coefficients along with a visualization. We will find which predictors have the strongest correlations, but we will find that the correlations are fairly weak for all predictors. Therefore, we will choose the predictors with high correlations relative to all predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Although we are using correlation to choose which predictors to use, we need to be aware that correlation does not imply causation - confounding variables or third variables may be affecting the results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use forward selection to build a model with no predictor at first and then iteratively add a new predictor at a time until a stopping rule is satisfied, such as the maximum number of predictors allowed or the lack of statistical significance for any remaining predictors. The best model will be selected based on cross-validation accuracy and a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The following are general steps when performing forward selection: \n",
    "- Start with a model having no predictors.\n",
    "- For each unused predictor, add it to the model to form a candidate model.\n",
    "- Tune all of the candidate models.\n",
    "- Update the model to be the candidate model with the highest cross-validation accuracy.\n",
    "- Select the model that provides the best trade-off between accuracy and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is beneficial for building predictive models because it offers a systematic way to identify the most important predictors, can handle large numbers of predictors, reduces the risk of overfitting, and improves model accuracy and interpretability by selecting the best set of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot or heat map can be created with prices as the dependent variable and the most prominent variables as independent variables to visualize the results of the analysis. This way any trends or patterns that may exist can be more easily visualized."

    "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the proximity of Airbnb listings to popular attractions and amenities and their impact on guest satisfaction and listing price. We found that our hypothesis was supported by the data, as the proximity of Airbnb locations to metro stations had a positive impact on guest satisfaction and an increase in listing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results suggest that Airbnb listings located closer to popular attractions and amenities (metro stations) tend to have higher guest satisfaction and command higher prices than those farther away. This finding has important implications for both hosts and guests. Hosts can use this information to improve their marketing strategy and adjust their pricing accordingly, while guests can use it to make more informed decisions about where to stay when traveling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of our findings could also extend to the tourism industry as a whole. As more tourists flock to popular attractions, businesses in the surrounding areas could experience increased traffic and revenue. However, this could also lead to issues such as overcrowding and strain on local resources. Further research could explore which specific businesses or industries would be most impacted by increased tourism, both positively and negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, our findings could also inform the development of urban planning strategies aimed at creating more sustainable and equitable cities. By identifying the amenities and attractions that are most strongly associated with higher guest satisfaction and pricing in different cities or regions, policymakers can make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and prioritize development projects."
